  "hero": "As a developer I pride myself on versatility, I want to create tools and games that people will play. By doing so I want to leave a lasting footprint in the code I helped write and lay the foundations for other ideas to sprout. As a graduate of Digital Arts and Entertainment, I have been taught the work ethic that is required to make a project succeed. And I am always looking for the my next mission to make something amazing happen.",
  "about": [
    "Since I graduated, I've been looking for an opportunity to put my skills to the test. I want to make something, a game that people will talk about. When I know the basics of something, I want to delve deeper and figure out more about how it works. Between the various tasks that a game developer needs to be able to do, I have tried my hand at any and all of the different disciplines. Programming, 3D, Rigging, animation and even writing. I have tried to do a little bit of everything so I can grasp what other people want when they talk about what they do.",
    "There are lots of things that I could talk about, but I only have so much space on the screen. If you would like to know more about me give that friendly looking button a click, or use one of the buttons at the bottom of the page!"
