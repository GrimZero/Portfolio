  "about": [
    "I'm always looking for an opportunity to put my skills to the test. I want to make a game, something people will talk about and say they enjoy it. Between the various tasks that a game developer needs to be able to do, I have tried my hand at any and all of the different disciplines. Programming, 3D, Rigging, Animation and even Writing. I have tried to do a little bit of everything so I can grasp what other people want when they talk about what they do. Everyone has something to offer, it is up to the rest of the team to figure out what that is.",
    "There are lots of things that I could talk about, but I only have so much space on the screen. If you would like to know more about me give those friendly looking buttons at the bottom of the page a click!"
