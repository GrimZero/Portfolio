      "what": "For a project involving scanning of tangible fabrics, I was tasked to make a tool that could read and modify texture data. It would be used to scan an existing fabric and digitize it. Whereafter it would get grayscaled and as such can be used as a base material for PBR. The VIZIO scanner that was used to scan the fabrics outputs the PBR materials and after processing they are processed and imported into the library.",
      "why": "This was created as an automation tool for artists to use so that they would not have to manually adjust the images into a working grayscale image.",
      "how": "I created this in WPF, while also using Unity running server side as a database, The application hooks into the VIZIO scanner process and reads the textures when it is done scanning them and generating the textures. These textures are then grayscaled (along with packing the metallic and roughness together to save some space) and imported into a scriptable object that is generated and added to the database. The entire image processing is handled by EmguCV, a wrapper library of OpenCV."

      "what": "In this couch co-op game you play as either an officer or a donut truck. The goal of the game is for the police to recover his donuts, because the truck ran off without giving him his order! The player is meant to battle the truck with various power ups to try and get the truck to stop and get himself a reward. While the truck has to try and avoid getting caught.",
      "how": "I picked up the role of a technical artist. With a team of 4 programmers, we all needed to jump in  to help our artist. Most of my time was spent helping to create the models and rigging, as 3 people is enough to do the programming. This project was made entirely in Unity and was reported on a weekly basis and had daily stand-up just like with a SCRUM team."

      ],
      "what": "A tool that takes the unity-generated meta files and hides / unhides them.",
      "why": "Unity creates a metadata file for every file and directory in the project, this can quickly get cluttered and make it hard to identify objects in the windows explorer. Therefore I felt like this should be done automattically.",
      "how": "Windows allows access to the flags controlling various parameters of files, and as such we can modify the properties of said files. As an added bonus I made sure I could watch for file changes in a directory, and not have to manually hide the files when a new one is created. The settings can be overridden from the console application running in the background, and there is logging to keep track of which files were hidden when and where they are located that can be read back whenever."

      "softwareUsed": [
        "WPF"
      ],
      "what": "This program manages data for me on a plex server and does not require user interference. Whenever a file is moved as well, both the original location and the destination are logged, to make sure that if a file goes corrupt or missing for any reason I can easily track down what and where the file is to resolve it. ",
      "why": "Managing a database of assets or files, even on a smaller scale can be quite tedious. When a file is downloaded I needed to manually move the files to a new directory, creating one in the process where required. However, after doing this for a few weeks I realised I could write something to do this for me.",
      "how": "Most of the process happens automatically. Using several API's to check what a file is and where it is supposed to go, I can figure out what goes where and make sure everything is in the right place. Matching a downloaded movie to its IMDB page, makes it possible to correctly identify the movie and as such find possible typos in the file system. I used a fuzzy search to make sure there is a margin for error. Additionally, this tool uses the FileSystemWatcher to make sure that files get transferred automatically. To move files around I am using a kernel32.dll property to speed up the process of moving the objects around. This is a significant increase in performance compared to the regular file moving operations in C#. With a little added complexity, I was able to speed up and async move files at about 10 times the speed of the regular operation."

        "Angular"
      ],
      "why": "Creating a nice looking portfolio is one of the things that every developer should have, and considering I had to learn the ins and outs of Angular. I felt it appropriate to make it using this.",
      "how": "Coming from C# and starting to learn javascript, followed by typescript has its challenges, but it ended up being a fun project nonetheless. Working with Typescript and the Angular framework was a lot easier as it is a more object oriented approach to Javascript. Additional research into threejs and WebGL rendering in the browser, along with some modelling was quite a nice addition. Threejs is fully rendered on the front-end, it works in a canvas using the WebGL renderer. On top of that, there was a lot of optimization to be done with the models. Threejs has support for FBX, but using GlTF files results in a much quicker loadtime."

      ],
      "what": "This project is a node editor, created in unity, to make it possible to create a branching dialogue system with events inside Unity.",
      "why": "For a narrative builder I decided it would be nice to have a node editor. working together with a writer, he needed a tool to be able to write events and dialogue without needing to write code. So I wrote a node editor so that he could easily design the NPC and world the way he wanted without needing to write any code.",
      "how": "To make one there are different available API's to use, I tried both the Unity experimental Shadergraph API and xNode. While I was working with the ShaderGraph API, I found myself quite lost, there was not all the much documentation and with the API still being experimental it was bound to be a nuisance to get everything right. I found myself stuck working with USS and UIElements in the UnityEngine, and after running into one too manny roadblocks, I decided to look for an alternative. The alternative was xNode, an open-source framework that allows you to make a custom node editor the way you want to."
