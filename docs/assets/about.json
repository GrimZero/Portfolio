        "Hello, my name is Torben and welcome to my portfolio! I am a developer with a passion for games and the knowledge to back it up. When I work on projects, I look for the best and most efficient way to get something done.",
        "As a programmer I found that solving problems is my main task. Fixing an issue that someone has in an easy to use way. Creating the tools for a company to get their product finished in an efficient way.",
        "I like spending my free time playing games and watching anime. But more often than not I find myself trying out new things that I can do with code and doing some research."
