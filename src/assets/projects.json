            "details": "This tool was created to help process a tangible fabric and making a PBR material out of it. The VIZIO scanner outputs the files required for the pipeline, but does not do any processing. The main purpose of this tool was to take the output from the scanner and adjust the texture color, so that the fabric can be digitally colored without the need to scan a different color fabric.",
            "implementation": "This project was created using WPF, which I had never used before. However, I picked it up rather quickly. I tried a few different approaches to load and edit the textures, quickly learning that doing this type of operations on the GPU seemed like a good idea. To be able to do this I had to look for a library that could use a shader as opposed to the CPU to process images. I found EmguCV, which is a .NET wrapper for the C++ equivalent. The conversion process was automated using the algorithms Photoshop is using, and ran in the background while someone was scanning one of the fabrics."

For this project we worked with a team of 5 people (1 artist and 4 programmers) to make a couch co-op game. This game was meant to be made during a single semester, and to be presented at the end. We struggled with finding the right balance with the concept. We knew what we wanted to make, but had some issues balancing the upgrades. Overal the team effort was balanced and there was a good dynamic.",
            "implementation": "For this project I worked mostly as a technical artist. With a team of 4 programmers, we all needed to pull a little work away from him. As a technical artist I was responsible for a good amount of particles, along with creating models, making rigs and animations. I also had a hand in the code of the project, but did not focus on this because it was not necessary with the team we had. Apart from that, while the UI was not completely finished, most of the code taking care of the on-screen elements was implemented together with our artist to achieve a nice feel to it."

            "implementation": "The way it works is by changing one of the attributes responsible for making the component visible. Windows than knows that file is meant to be hidden and does not show it in the file browser. It's just a small tool, but it doesn't always need to be complex to make for an interesting project."

There are a large variety of tools available that can do a lot of things. but for Plex specifically we did not have what we were looking for.

            "implementation": "Implemented with a minor interface in WPF, most of the process happens automatically and is mainly used for logging. Using several API's to check what a file is and where it is supposed to go, I can figure  out what goes where and make sure everything is in the right place. "

I found out that with my lack of knowledge of javascript, that I was struggling to get things right. However, working in typescript and the angular framework was a lot easier as it is a more object oriented approach to javascript. to me there was no better way to learn the framework than to actually make a website with it. Therefore I decided to make my portfolio with it!"
